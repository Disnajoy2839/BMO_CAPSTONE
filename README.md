# RFQ and PO Automation System for Engineered Electric Controls

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated procurement system for Engineered Electric Controls. The system will leverage Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, automated workflows, and real-time dashboards to improve supplier relationship management, reduce errors, and enhance procurement accuracy. Azure will be used for scalability and security, supporting features like real-time procurement insights and BOM uploads.

## Key Features
- **Automated PO and RFQ Workflows**: Streamlining the procurement process by automating purchase orders and request-for-quote workflows.
- **BOM Uploads**: Supporting uploads of Bills of Materials (BOM) in image, PDF, and Excel formats.
- **Supplier Response Tracking**: Automating notifications and tracking for supplier responses.
- **Packing Slip Reconciliation**: Reducing inconsistencies through automated packing slip reconciliation.
- **Real-Time Procurement Insights**: Providing a dashboard to track procurement activities in real-time.

## Project Scope
The project is focused on developing an automated system that improves the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of procurement operations. The system will include automated workflows for processing RFQs and POs, as well as integration with Azure for enhanced security and scalability.

### In-Scope Features:
- Automation of PO and RFQ workflows.
- Automated tracking of supplier communications and responses.
- Azure integration for improved scalability and security.

### Out-of-Scope:
- Full integration with ERP systems.
- Post-project maintenance and support.
- Advanced AI capabilities beyond OCR-based data extraction.

## Technology Stack
- **Azure**: For cloud hosting, scalability, and security.
- **OCR Technology**: For automated data extraction from documents like invoices, quotes, and BOMs.
- **Real-time Dashboards**: For procurement insights and progress tracking.
- **API Integration**: To communicate with other systems and streamline the procurement process.
